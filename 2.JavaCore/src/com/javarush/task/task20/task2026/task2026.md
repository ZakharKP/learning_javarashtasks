## task2026

1. An N*N two-dimensional array is given that contains several rectangles.
2. Different rectangles do not touch or overlap.
3. Inside the rectangle is all filled with 1.
4. In array:<br>
	4.1. a[i, j] = 1 if element (i, j) belongs to some rectangle<br>
	4.2. a[i, j] = 0, otherwise<br>
5. getRectangleCount must return the number of rectangles.
6. The main method is not involved in testing


# Requirements:
1. The Solution class must have a getRectangleCount method with one `byte[][]` type parameter.
2. The getRectangleCount method must be public.
3. The getRectangleCount method must be static.
4. The getRectangleCount method must return the number of rectangles (according to the task) found in the resulting array.
