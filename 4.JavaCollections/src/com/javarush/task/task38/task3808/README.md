# Task 3808
# Incorrect annotations

Fix incorrect annotations. The code should compile without errors or warnings.

Avoid redundancy. You do not need to write all the annotations you know in a row.


## Requirements:

1. The @Main annotation should only be used to annotate methods.
2. The main method of the Solution class should only be marked with the @Main annotation.
3. The overriddenMethod of the SubSolution class must only be marked with the @Override annotation.
4. In the uncheckedCall method, unchecked warnings must be suppressed using an annotation.
