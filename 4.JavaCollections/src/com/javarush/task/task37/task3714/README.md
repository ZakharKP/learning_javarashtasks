# Task 3714
# Ancient Rome

Amigo, hello! I recently became interested in the history of your planet and I was interested in the period of Ancient Rome.
It was interesting then to live, continuous entertainment and wine! Or slavery, if you're unlucky with your starting location...

In general, I need a romanToInteger method that will convert a number to
Roman number system {I, V, X, L, C, D, M} to decimal. Otherwise, there is no way to make out what
when they happened.


## Requirements:
1. The romanToInteger method must convert a number in the Roman numeral system to decimal.
2. The romanToInteger method must return an int value and take one parameter of the String type.
3. The romanToInteger method must be public.
4. The romanToInteger method must be static.
