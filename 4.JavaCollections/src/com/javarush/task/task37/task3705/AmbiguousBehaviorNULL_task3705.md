# Task 3705
# Ambiguous behavior for NULL

Change the implementation of the getExpectedMap method, it should return an object of such a class, for which the opposite will be
behavior when adding a null reference.
See the output example in the main method.
Do not change the rest of the code.


## Requirements:
1. The getExpectedMap method must not return a Hashtable object.
2. The getExpectedMap method must return a standard Map implementation that satisfies the task condition.
3. The main method of the Solution class must display data on the screen.
4. The getExpectedMap method must be static.
