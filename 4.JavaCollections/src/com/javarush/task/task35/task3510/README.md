# Task 3510
# Entrance prohibited!

Analyze the classes in the problem.
In the main method, two houses are created: one for cats and one for dogs.
However, now, when a dog enters the cat house, a conflict arises and all the cats in it are forced to leave the house (checkConflicts method).

Help the cats protect your home from strangers and prevent them from accidentally entering the dog house.
To do this, parameterize House with type T and make the appropriate changes to the class implementation.

The main method does not take part in testing.


## Requirements:
1. The House class must be parameterized with type T.
2. The residents field in the House class must be parameterized with type T.
3. The enter method in the House class must accept an object of type T.
4. The leave method in the House class must accept an object of type T.
5. The checkConflicts method in the House class is no longer needed and should be removed.
