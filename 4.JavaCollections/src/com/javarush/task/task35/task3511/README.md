# Task 3511
# Wildcards for collections

The Solution class implements 4 methods for working with lists:
sum - sums all elements of a list containing any numbers,
multiply - multiplies with each other all elements of the list, which contains any numbers,
concat - concatenates all elements of a list into one string,
combine - takes a list of any collections as input and returns the resulting list, which contains all the elements from the lists.

Add a suitable template (wildcard) for each incoming List type so that the method can only accept elements that it can process.


## Requirements:
1. For the parameter type of the sum(List list) method, you need to add a suitable template (wildcard).
2. For the parameter type of the multiply(List list) method, you need to add a suitable template (wildcard).
3. For the parameter type of the concat(List list) method, you need to add a suitable template (wildcard).
4. For the parameter type of the combine(List list) method, you need to add a suitable template (wildcard).
