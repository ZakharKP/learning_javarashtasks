# Method refactoring

Refactor the writeZipEntriesToFile method to match the java7 try-with-resources.

The program should not contain commented code.


# Requirements:
1. The writeZipEntriesToFile method must be declared with the public access modifier.
2. The writeZipEntriesToFile method must be static.
3. The return type of the writeZipEntriesToFile method must be void.
4. The writeZipEntriesToFile method must correctly use try-with-resources.
