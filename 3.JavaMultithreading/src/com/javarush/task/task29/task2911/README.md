# And refactoring again Ó€ Java Multithreading: Level 9, Lecture 9

An integer from 0 to 999 inclusive is given randomly. The user enters a number from the keyboard.
The program responds if the entered number is greater or less than the guessed one. If in 10 attempts the user of the program
guesses the number - the program outputs:
"You guessed it!"
"Hidden number: [number]",
otherwise "You lost!".
Fix one bug so that the code does the described actions.


## Requirements:
1. If the correct number is not entered after 10 attempts, the program should display "You lost!".
2. If an invalid number is entered, the boolean flagWin flag must not be set to true.
3. Don't change method headers.
4. You need to make one change in the correct place in the program.
