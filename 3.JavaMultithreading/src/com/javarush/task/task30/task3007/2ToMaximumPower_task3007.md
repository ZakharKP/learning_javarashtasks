# Task 3007
# Find the number 2 to the maximum power

Implement the logic of the maxPowerOf2 method, which should return the number 2 to the 
	maximum power that can be placed in the passed number.
The maxPowerOf2 argument can only be a positive integer.
Use only operations:
1) Bit shifts.
2) Bitwise OR.
3) Bitwise AND.
4) Bitwise unary operator NOT.
5) Assignment (you can combine allowed operations with assignment, for example, &amp;=).
6) Parentheses.
Don't leave comments.
Don't declare any variables, just use the x that comes as the argument to the maxPowerOf2 method.
The main method does not take part in testing.


## Requirements:
1. The Solution class must contain the maxPowerOf2(int) method.
2. In the Solution class, use only allowed operations in the maxPowerOf2(int) method.
3. In the Solution class, in the maxPowerOf2(int) method, do not use unallowed operations.
4. The maxPowerOf2(int) method must return the number 2 to the maximum power that can be placed in the passed number.
