# Read on the Internet about the median of the sample

Implement the logic of the sort method, which should sort the data in the array by distance from its median.
Return the sorted array from minimum distance to maximum distance.
If the remoteness is the same for several numbers, then sort them in ascending order.
Input array example:
13, 8, 15, 5, 17
median - 13
sorted array:
13, 15, 17, 8, 5


## Requirements:
1. The program should not output text to the console.
2. The program should not read data from the console.
3. The Solution class must contain a public static method Integer[] sort(Integer[] array).
4. The sort(Integer[] array) method of the Solution class must sort the data in the array by distance from its median.
