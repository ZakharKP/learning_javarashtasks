# If there was a mind, there would be success

Soldiers have always been built, are being built and will be built in descending order of growth.
Sort the soldiers, having previously thought about what is better to use under such conditions - Comparable or Comparator.


## Requirements:
1. The Soldier class must contain private fields String name and int height.
2. The Soldier class must contain a constructor with two parameters String name and int height.
3. Think about what is better to use and implement Comparable or Comparator.
4. The Soldier class must contain the compareTo(Soldier solder) method.
5. The compareTo(Soldier solder) method should compare two soldiers, 
	considering only their height. You need to compare objects taking 
	into account the decrease in the growth of soldiers.
