# Politeness is an artificially created good mood

In the Solution class, create a public static IntegerHolder class.
IntegerHolder must be of type int (variable name must be value), thread safe, and mutable.
This class should have two public get and set methods.


## Requirements:
1. The Solution class must contain a public static IntegerHolder class.
2. The IntegerHolder class must contain a private value field of type int.
3. The IntegerHolder class must contain a public get() method that must return value.
4. The IntegerHolder class must contain a public set(int value) method, which must set value to the passed value.
5. The IntegerHolder class must be thread safe.
