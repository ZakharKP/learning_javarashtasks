# So, let's compare

Fix the bugs: move the clone methods to the classes where they should be implemented.
Remove redundant methods.
Don't remove the main method.


## Requirements:
1. In class C, the clone method without parameters must be implemented.
2. The Solution class must have a main method.
3. There must be 4 nested classes in the Solution class.
4. There must be 1 method in the Solution class.
5. The clone method in class C must return an object of type C.
