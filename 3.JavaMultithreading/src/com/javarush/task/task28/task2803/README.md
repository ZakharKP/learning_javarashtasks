# ThreadLocalRandom

The Solution class will be used by threads.
Implement the logic of all methods, use the ThreadLocalRandom class.
getRandomIntegerBetweenNumbers must return a random int between from and to.
getRandomDouble must return a random double.
getRandomLongBetween0AndN must return a random long between 0 and n.


## Requirements:
1. The Solution class should contain only static methods.
2. The getRandomIntegerBetweenNumbers method using ThreadLocalRandom must return a random int [from..to].
3. The getRandomDouble method using ThreadLocalRandom must return a random double [0..1).
4. The getRandomLongBetween0AndN method using ThreadLocalRandom must return a random long [0..n].
