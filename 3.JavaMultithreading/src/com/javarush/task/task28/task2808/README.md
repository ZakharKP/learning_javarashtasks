# Mastering Callable

Implement the logic of the getTask method, which should return a Callable object.
The Callable object must calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to the passed number i, including i, and return it as a string.
The main method is not involved in testing.


## Requirements:
1. The Solution class must contain a static getTask(int) method.
2. The getTask method must return a Callable&lt;String&gt; object.
3. The Callable object must return as a string the sum of all numbers from 1 to the passed number i, including it
4. The sum must be correctly calculated for numbers of arbitrary length.
