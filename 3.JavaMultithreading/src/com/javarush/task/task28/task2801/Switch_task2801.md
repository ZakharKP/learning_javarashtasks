# Mastering switch

Implement the logic of the switchTest method:
1. Don't use conditional statements.
2. Use 1 switch, which has 2 cases and 1 default.
3. Expected output:
The output for E1.A is &quot;it&#39;s E1.A&quot;
The output for E1.B is &quot;it&#39;s E1.B&quot;
The output for E1.C is &quot;it&#39;s E1.C&quot;
The output for E1.Y is &quot;it&#39;s E1.Y&quot;
The output for E2.D is &quot;it&#39;s E2.D&quot;
The output for E2.E is &quot;it&#39;s E2.E&quot;
The output for E2.F is &quot;it&#39;s E2.F&quot;
The output for all other values is "undefined".


## Requirements:
1. The Solution class must contain the switchTest method and enums E1, E2, E3.
2. Implement the switchTest method using 1 switch that has 2 cases and 1 default.
3. The output to the console must match the condition of the task.
4. You can't use conditional statements.
