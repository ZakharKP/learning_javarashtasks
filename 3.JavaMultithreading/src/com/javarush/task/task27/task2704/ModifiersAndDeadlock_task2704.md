# Modifiers and deadlock

Arrange the modifiers so that a deadlock appears when working with this code.
The main method generates a deadlock, so it does not participate in testing.


## Requirements:
1. The field must be private.
2. The getField method should NOT be private.
3. The sout method must be declared with the synchronized modifier.
4. The sout2 method must be declared with the synchronized modifier.
